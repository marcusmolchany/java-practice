You and Yummy Noodle Bar have come a long way!

## Quick Recap and What's Next

Here's what you did to build your Web front end:

* [Constructed a Web Integration domain](../1/) that effectively encapsulates the concerns of a Web front end without corrupting the core components of the Yummy Noodle Bar. 
* [Implemented Spring MVC Controllers and returned data](../2/).
* [Understood the Spring and Java Web configuration and implemented it for you application](../3/).
* Ran your Web Front end service using Gradle as well as packaged your service as a WAR file.
* [Created HTML views using Thymeleaf, and made HTML fragments to help with layout.](../4/).
* [Handled form submissions and different HTTP verbs from the browser](../5/)
* [Secured your application](../6/) to authenticate and ensure that users only access the Orders they have created.
